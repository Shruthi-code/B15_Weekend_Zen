1) Difference btw HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2?

	In HTTP/1.1, it keeps all requests and responses in plain text format and 
	cannot send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection.

	In HTTP/2, uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in 
	binary format where Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection, 
	while still maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers.

2) GET vs POST?

	GET(Read Data):
	
	-In case of Get request, only limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header.
	-Get request is not secured because data is exposed in URL bar.
	-Get request can be bookmarked.
	-Get request is idempotent . It means second request will be ignored until response of first request is delivered.
	-Get request is more efficient and used more than Post.

	POST(Insert Data):

	-In case of post request, large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body.
	-Post request is secured because data is not exposed in URL bar.
	-Post request cannot be bookmarked.
	-Post request is non-idempotent.
	-Post request is less efficient and used less than get.
